`volo-thrift` implements a Thrift-based RPC framework.

Users rarely need to use volo-thrift directly. Instead, they should use the `Client` and `Server` in the generated code.

For extension developers, they may need to use some of the components in `volo-thrift`.

For detailed guides, please refer to the [guides](https://www.cloudwego.io/docs/volo/).
